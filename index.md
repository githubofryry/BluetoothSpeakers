### January 9th, 2018

A day late on the blog post but here is my Progress Report!

* The applications that I used for this project is [MPG123](https://www.mpg123.de), and [mpyst(youtube player)](https://github.com/mps-youtube/mps-youtube
).
* [Link to where I followed to make this project working](https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-speaker-bonnet-for-raspberry-pi/overview) 
* Current Progress: I am basically done but I have to consider to stop using alligator clips and make a box for the speaker if I have time.
* Financial Update: Only need to about $10 on wood and laser printing or I can find left over wood around campus and go to the prototype lab.

PCB Board
  * traffic2B - LED was blinking when the program ran. It went successful.
  * ghmain - While the program was running, the sensor detected the light whenever someone tries to cover the sensor.
Here are images from today's lab before testing.

### November 29, 2017
  After going through a phone call with Adafruit, it seems that they the order was invalid and did not ship my items.
  So they told me they were going to refund my money and try to pay via paypal this time. I will trust them a 2nd time because I only can  buy the ampilifer there. Here is a confirmation email.
