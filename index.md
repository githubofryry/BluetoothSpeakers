Strike is done. 
  * Still have yet soldering my PCB (Will be doing this today and on Novemeber 30, 2017)
  * Having a shipping issue with my parts. May have to order it somewhere else.
  
  Edit 1 ### November 29, 2017
  After going through a phone call with Adafruit, it seems that they the order was invalid and did not ship my items.
  So they told me they were going to refund my money and try to pay via paypal this time. I will trust them a 2nd time because I only buy the ampilifer there. Here is a confirmation email.
