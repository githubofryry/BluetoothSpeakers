### Introduction

The Speaker Bonnet is a stereo amplifier for the Raspberry Pi. This Speaker Bonnet is used for audio for any UNIX-like OS.
This build instruction will teach you how to build your own Speaker Bonnet!
For the music player, we will be using mpg123 for this project. 

### What you will need

What will you need for this:

**WARNING: Be sure to use a 2.5A/5V if you will be using 4W 3ohm speaker or using 2 speakers on the Speaker Bonnet. It is not recommended to use a charging brick that does not have the power to do so. This could damage your Pi.**

If you already have a micro SD card and do not care about the case then you could just buy the Raspberry Pi itself.

Either a ![8ohm 1W speaker](https://github.com/githubofryry/BluetoothSpeakers/blob/master/documentation/IMG_4653.JPG?raw=true) 
or 4ohm 3W speaker 

(Will be using the 8ohm 1W for this project)

### Assembly

First what you will need to do is solder the parts given to your the speaker bonnet. If you are not confident on 
soldering then I would suggest to watch youtube videos on it first before attempting to solder. 
[Soldering Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqvHogekDI4)

Now when you know how to solder, go ahead and solder the 20 pin and the right/left terminals on the back of the border.
I suggest to do this one part at a time and take your time soldering.
It should look like this when completed.

Once the Speaker Bonnet is soldered, then you can now start hooking it up to the Pi and Speakers.

Insert the Speaker Bonnet on the 20pin of the Raspberry Pi

Then get the jumper cables and plug them accordingly into the terminal (+ = red jumper, - = black jumper | You can use any colour but I recommend using red and black for quality of life). If you can manage
