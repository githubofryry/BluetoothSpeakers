### Introduction

The Speaker Bonnet is a stereo amplifier for the Raspberry Pi. This Speaker Bonnet is used for audio for any UNIX-like OS.
This build instruction will teach you how to build your own Speaker Bonnet!
For the music player, we will be using mpg123 for this project. 

### What you will need

What will you need for this:

![A raspberry pi](https://github.com/githubofryry/BluetoothSpeakers/blob/master/documentation/IMG_4651.JPG?raw=true)

[Link for the raspberry pi](https://www.amazon.ca/CanaKit-Raspberry-Complete-Starter-Kit/dp/B01CCF6V3A/ref=sr_1_5?s=electronics&ie=UTF8&qid=1516598053&sr=1-5&keywords=raspberry+pi+3)

If you already have a micro SD card and do not care about the case then you could just buy the Raspberry Pi itself

Either a ![8ohm 1W speaker](https://github.com/githubofryry/BluetoothSpeakers/blob/master/documentation/IMG_4653.JPG?raw=true) 
or 4ohm 3W speaker 

(Will be using the 8ohm 1W for this project)

### Assembly

First what you will need to do is solder the parts given to your the speaker bonnet. If you are not confident on 
soldering then I would suggest to watch youtube videos on it first before attempting to solder. 
[Soldering Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqvHogekDI4)

Now when you know how to solder, go ahead and solder the 20 pin and the right/left terminals on the back of the border.
I suggest to do this one part at a time and take your time soldering.
It should look like this when completed.
